# ExplainerDashboard

**Here is a short FAQ about this repository**

**1) What is this repository about?**

In this repository, we are going to build Interactive dashboard for a Machine Learning model using ExplainerDashboard library in Python.
The jupyter notebook (.ipynb) and this readme provide the code and all the relevant information about this tutorial.

**2) What is ExplainerDashboard?**

ExplainerDashboard is a library for quickly building interactive dashboards for analyzing and explaining the predictions and workings of (scikit-learn compatible) machine learning models, including xgboost, catboost and lightgbm. This makes your model transparant and explainable with just two lines of code. It is a python package which generates interactive dashboards which allow users to understand as well as explain how the model works and how it is deciding the outcome. Without such a tool, a machine learning model is a “Black Box model” . Hence, it becomes difficult to explain the reason behind the decision made by the model and which factors are impacting its decision making. 

**3) Which libraries has been used for creation for dashboard?**

For this tutorial, we have used a library called ExplainerDashboard. Using this package in Python, we can easily deploy a dashboard as a web app in Jupyter or Colab notebooks.

**4) Which dataset has been used?**

We are using the sk-learn toydataset 'Diabetes Prediction' to train the Regression model and build the interactive Machine Learning dashboard.

**Details of the Dashboard and model setup are discussed in my article published on TowardsDataScience**
